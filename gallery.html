            <p>I met Stephen and we started talking about hypergraphs. A genuinely nice guy and very fun to talk to. He asked if I use Mathematica, to which I replied "No, I prefer <a href="https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html">Sympy</a> and <a href="https://www.sagemath.org/">SageMath</a>", which he laughed at.</p>
